            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>
                Wikipedia has no central editorial board. Contributions are made by a large number of volunteers at their own discretion. Edits are neither the responsibility of the Wikimedia Foundation (the organisation that hosts the site) nor of its staff and edits will not generally be made in response to an email request.
                Although Wikipedia was founded by Jimmy Wales, he is not personally responsible for our content.
                If you have questions about the concept of Wikipedia rather than a specific problem, the About Wikipedia page may help.
                If you want to ask other users for help with editing or using Wikipedia, stop by the Teahouse, Wikipedia's live help channel, or the help desk to ask someone for assistance.
                If you disagree with an article's content, or are involved in a content dispute, see Dispute resolution.
            
            The links on the left should direct you to how to contact us or resolve problems. If you cannot find your issue listed there, you can email helpful, experienced volunteers at info-en@wikimedia.org. Please refrain from emailing about disagreements with content; they will not be resolved via email.

        <h2>Our Policy</h2>
            <p>
               
                Policy is a deliberate system of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization. Policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision making. Policies used in subjective decision-making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result, are often hard to test objectively, e.g. work–life balance policy... Moreover, Governments and other institutions have policies in the form of laws, regulations, procedures, administrative actions, incentives and voluntary practices. Frequently, resource allocations mirror policy decisions.
